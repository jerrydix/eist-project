# System Design Document

The following system design document will provide an overview over the system design of the Garching Airlines flight infotainment system. This SDD will describe the essential parts of the client-server-architecture and its functionality, including descriptions of functional and nonfunctional requirements which were provided by the head EIST tutors.

The target audience of the Garching Airlines infotainment system are any potential plane passengers who use the system to browse for flights, book them and thus plan out their trips. Moreover, the system provides assistance for in-flight services, which means that anyone flying with a plane equipped with the GAIS is part of the target audience.
